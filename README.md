- 👋 Hi, I’m @hrosman94
- 👀 I’m interested in software development of all kinds! I have a background in both modular and object-oriented programming, relational databases, parallel programming, and computer architecture. Outside of that, I enjoy lifting weights, and music production.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, since I've always been curious about game development.
- 📫 How to reach me: healyrosman@gmail.com
